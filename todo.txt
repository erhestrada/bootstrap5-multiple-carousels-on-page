TODO - prioritize backend
High Priority
0. for you page (follows) (follow category, follow streamer, follow clipper)
1. follows, notifications
2. profile/login
3. explore?
4. take virtualcasino out?
5. move main carousel buttons closer
link streamer names to twitch streamer page <==
category link to twitch category page (link to other location in clipsTracker?)
Low Priority
1. like, dislike, favorite => up arrow, down arrow, star
settings - languages

Extra
1. youutube, kick
2. reddit label for if posted on reddit, maybe view comments section within site
    upvote tracking
3. loading icon?
4. browse clips by category? ~twitch/categories
mini player, hide streamer bar
Debug
0. browse page categories looping? ones lower down don't activate carousel
1. clicking on donut button first thing not working - certain information hasn't been set
first clip on main page is wrong now -- using localstorage for browse too, could be conflicting
5. add thumbnail info to streamer bar carousel
6. ends of carousels specifically right side end
keep category fixed? only scroll games?
7. errors in console (div id name?)
await until all assets loaded?
playlists?
save data in database for scalability (minimize requests)
Jakson pfp not loading? (gta)
highlight is persisting, not resetting on different click

repeats in browse categories for some reason, check if already on page (thinking it's built in to pagination on twitch's end)

discover
(same category / different category)
(same streamer / different streamer)

refactor localStorage uses to window where applicable

community liked clips
slider for box art to change category, up/down, maybe a search box


make log/signup popups <== (easy)
move away from local storage and instead save all the thumbnail data in custom attributes on the element, simpler and more intuitive
customize scrollbar

make likes/dislikes/favorites thumbnails that open the clip on click ~ youtube
remove like/dislike/favorite

issue with choppiness on slide (same issue when did infinitescroll)
    add more sliders to main page? definitely want more but don't want to be choppy

in makeCarouselForCategory.js
    should porbably be doing
    const idFormattedCategory = category.replace(/ /g, '-').replace(/:/g, ''); -- i actually need to be doing this for all possible invalid characters
    for
    <div class="carousel-inner" id="${category}-carousel-inner">
    but will need to change downstream in getTopClips

donut button press down effect
alerts/notifications

filter languages higher up
autoplay
move highlighted thumbnail when next/prev arrow clicked in main player
twitch-like main player display where you can at least see next/prev
save gameid if new
