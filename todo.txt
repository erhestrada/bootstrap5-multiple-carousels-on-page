Debug
3. main carousel buttons don't work
4. thumbnails not displaying?
5. add thumbnail info to streamer bar carousel

for the main carousel, i'm just replacing the current clip with the next one, no sliding is actually happening
for the rest of the carousels i am sliding

clicking on carousel2 adds a bunch of excess spacing again, need to take otu that height line

issue with choppiness on slide (same issue when did infinitescroll)
    add more sliders to main page? definitely want more but don't want to be choppy

in makeCarouselForCategory.js
    should porbably be doing
    const idFormattedCategory = category.replace(/ /g, '-').replace(/:/g, ''); -- i actually need to be doing this for all possible invalid characters
    for
    <div class="carousel-inner" id="${category}-carousel-inner">
    but will need to change downstream in getTopClips

donut button press down effect
alerts/notifications

filter languages higher up
autoplay
move highlighted thumbnail when next/prev arrow clicked in main player
twitch-like main player display where you can at least see next/prev
