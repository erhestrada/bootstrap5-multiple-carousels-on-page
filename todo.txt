3. main carousel buttons don't work
4. thumbnails not displaying?
5. add thumbnail info to streamer bar carousel

for the main carousel, i'm just replacing the current clip with the next one, no sliding is actually happening
for the rest of the carousels i am sliding

clicking on carousel2 adds a bunch of excess spacing again, need to take otu that height line

issue with choppiness on slide (same issue when did infinitescroll)

in makeCarouselForCategory.js
    should porbably be doing
    const idFormattedCategory = category.replace(/ /g, '-').replace(/:/g, '');
    for
    <div class="carousel-inner" id="${category}-carousel-inner">
    but will need to change downstream in getTopClips
